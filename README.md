# 03652025_Churning_Customers
Nhyira_Wilson Churning customers
I started by importing the necessary libraries, including Streamlit for creating web applications, k
keras for loading a pre-trained neural network model, NumPy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for preprocessing.
I loaded the pre-trained model, made a prediction function and loaded the Streamlit web app.
the web app aimed to create a simple web interface allowing users to input customer information, and it uses the pre-trained neural network to predict the possibility of churn based on that input.
